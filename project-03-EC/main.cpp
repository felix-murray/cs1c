/*

- Add a default and alternate constructors to ExtendedTime to initialize all
class (including the base class) data; use the base member
initialization list. 

- NOTE: This implies implementing default, alternate constructors for class Time as well.
2. Class Invoice contains a private data member purchase_time of
type Time. Write default, alternate constructors for Invoice
which initializes purchase_time; use the base member
initialization list.
3. We would like to be able to print out dates for class
ExtendedTime seamlessly to the console via COUT. Add an
overloaded insertion stream operator << to ExtendedTime. Do
the same for the Invoice class. You will need to use a friend.

4. Instantiate ExtendedTime, Invoice objs in client code (passing
data to alternate constructors). Print out class data to the
console via <<.
